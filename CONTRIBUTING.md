Thanks for helping grow this resource! A few simple rules keep quality high and consistent.

## Adding a new question

1. Pick the right topic file under `topics/`. If none fit, propose a new file in your PR description.
2. Follow this exact format:

```markdown
### Q: <question, phrased the way an interviewer would ask it>

**Answer:**
<Concise, correct, interview-ready answer. Prefer 3–8 sentences or a short structured
list over a wall of text. Include a formula or code snippet only if it genuinely
clarifies the answer.>

**Follow-up:** <one likely follow-up question an interviewer might ask next, optional>

<details>
<summary>Difficulty & tags</summary>

`Difficulty: Easy | Medium | Hard` · `Tags: e.g. bias-variance, regularization`

</details>

---
```

3. Keep answers **interview-length**, not textbook-length. If it wouldn't fit in a 2–3 minute spoken answer, trim it.
4. Cite sources only for non-obvious facts (benchmarks, specific paper results) — link, don't paste large excerpts.
5. No duplicate questions — search the topic file first.

## Style

- Use `**bold**` for key terms, not whole sentences.
- Code blocks should be runnable/valid syntax (Python 3 or standard SQL unless stated otherwise).
- Avoid opinionated claims presented as fact (e.g., "X is always better than Y") — frame trade-offs instead.

## Opening a PR

- One topic file per PR where possible, to keep reviews fast.
- Briefly describe what you added/changed in the PR description.

## Reporting an issue

Found a wrong or outdated answer? Open an issue tagged `correction` with the question text and a brief explanation, or just submit a PR with the fix directly.
